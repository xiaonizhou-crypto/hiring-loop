# HR Agent Team

A minimal prototype for a small HR Agent Team workflow.

This repo captures the smallest working loop that is already running:

- Resume Screener
- Candidate Coordinator
- Hiring Ops Tracker
- Feishu table update

It is **not** a full ATS, HRMS, or recruiting platform.
It is a lightweight prototype for a working hiring loop.

## What is already working

### 1) Resume Screener
Handles first-pass screening for incoming resumes.

### 2) Candidate Coordinator
Handles only 3 actions:
- request-more-info message
- interview scheduling message
- candidate reply summary

### 3) Hiring Ops Tracker
Handles only 4 actions:
- current stage
- current owner
- next step
- blocked / timeout status

## Current workflow
